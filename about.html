                <h3>What is Trivia Night?</h3>
                <p>
                    Hello! Welcome to Trivia Night, where you will compete against
                    one another through a series of questions. Students/teams are given a time
                    limit of 10 seconds to answer each question. If a student/team is correct,
                    they will be awarded the value of the question (not an actual monetary payment).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To play, click a box for the selected category. Then, within the 10 second time frame, work with
                    one another, and select the best answer. Based on your accuracy, your 'total' will continually
                    update throughout the game. The game will continue until all questions have been answered, and the team with the most amount 
                    of money at the end of the game will be the winner!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Have fun!

                <p>
                    This Trivia Night is comprised of 5 categories: animals, history, sports, 21st century music, and
                    UPenn Coding Camp. It will calculate the total amount you've earned based on your right and wrong choices. (<b>NOTE</b>: If you
                    get an answer wrong, you <i>will</i> lose money, so be wary of your final answer!)

                <h3>Our Process</h3>
                <p>
                    While constructing this game, we decided to use all of the content that we've learned in the past 
                    two weeks and implement it into Trivia Night! For example, we created CSS style sheets for certain
                    pages and used Bootstrap to make it more appealing to our audience. We also created our grid display and 
                    buttons through Bootstrap - all of which makes it a user-friendly game. Along with this, we incorporated Javascript, JQuery, 
                    and the DOM to hold our questions/answers. For example, we created multiple arrays to hold the questions and answers through
                    Javascript, and executed them through JQuery - where we used it as a function for clicking the buttons!
